# Urban Route Optimization in Bursa: TSP-with-Neighborhoods

This project presents a comparative performance analysis of different algorithms for solving the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** using real road network data from the Osmangazi district of Bursa, Turkey. The study evaluates **Greedy Insertion**, **Google OR-Tools**, and **Genetic Algorithm** approaches in terms of route length and computational efficiency.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to determine the shortest route among **10 main centers** generated by clustering randomly selected points within a **7 km radius** urban road network in Bursa.

- **Data Source:** Real road network data retrieved using the OSMnx library  
- **Modeling:** Distance matrix construction using K-Means clustering and Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm  
- **Experimental Design:** **30 independent experiments** conducted for statistical reliability  

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **OSMnx & NetworkX:** Road network analysis and node snapping  
- **Google OR-Tools:** Advanced routing and optimization solutions  
- **Scikit-learn:** K-Means clustering algorithm  
- **Folium:** Interactive map visualization  
- **Matplotlib:** Performance and comparison plots  

## 📊 Compared Algorithms

1. **Greedy Insertion**  
   Iteratively inserts the node that causes the minimum increase in total tour length.  
   Extremely fast but prone to local optima.

2. **OR-Tools (Routing Library)**  
   Utilizes branch-and-bound and local search strategies.  
   Achieves the highest solution quality and robustness.

3. **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**  
   Employs OX1 crossover and swap mutation over **200 generations**.  
   Well-suited for complex and flexible constraint settings.

## 📈 Performance Results (Average of 30 Runs)

| Algorithm | Avg. Route Length (km) | Avg. Runtime (s) | Success Rate |
|---------|------------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **OR-Tools** | 43.17 | 0.00448 | 90.0% |
| **Genetic Algorithm** | 43.82 | 2.07000 | 6.7% |
| **Greedy Insertion** | 44.39 | 0.00026 | 3.3% |

### 🔍 Key Insights

- **OR-Tools** provides the best balance between speed and solution quality, making it suitable for industrial-scale applications.  
- **Greedy Insertion**, while extremely fast, produces routes that are on average **2.8–5% longer**.  
- **Genetic Algorithm** can outperform OR-Tools in specific scenarios (e.g., Experiments 5 and 20).
